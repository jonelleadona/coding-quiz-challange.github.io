# Coding Quiz Challenge 

For this assignment,I created a responsive quiz that asks a seriers of coding based questions. The quiz starts off with the main screen in which it provides the instructions as well as the start button. When the user clicks on the start button, the timer on the top right-hand corner will begin starting at 75 seconds. After hitting the start button, the user will be redirected to the questions page. On this page the answers will appear provided by buttons that contain the answer selections. If the user clicks on the wrong answer button, the timer will deduct 10 seconds from the remaing time. The next question will appear in response to any right or wrong button click. 

At the end of the quiz, the use will be presented with the time score. The user will then be able to input their initals which will be saved along side with thier time score. Once the input is saved and displayed, the user will have the option to clear the score board or go back to the start of the quiz. Throughout the whole quiz, the user can also go to score page at anytime to view saved score data.
